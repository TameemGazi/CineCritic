# About Project CineCritic (Build on AIA Chain)
# CineCritic
A blockchain-based movie review platform that rewards users with tokens for submitting reviews.
## Project Description
This project is a blockchain-based movie review platform where users can watch and review movies while earning rewards in the form of cryptocurrency tokens. The platform leverages smart contracts to store reviews on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and authenticity. Users can browse top-rated movies, submit their reviews, rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5, and earn tokens (AIA coins) as rewards for contributing their reviews.

The platform provides a seamless user experience with features like a user-friendly movie review form, a reward tracker displaying earned tokens, and a wallet connect button for easy integration with crypto wallets. Each review submission not only earns the user tokens but also contributes to a decentralized database of movie ratings and feedback. Additionally, users can withdraw their earned tokens through a simple interface.

The system promotes engagement by incentivizing users with tokens, making it ideal for movie enthusiasts who want to earn rewards for sharing their opinions. The project combines the entertainment industry with the power of blockchain technology, ensuring immutable, transparent, and tamper-proof movie reviews, while rewarding users in a fun and interactive way.
